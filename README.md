Our goal is to use direct images from a coronagraph to search for life on exoplanets. By analyzing exoplanet databases, we have derived several parameters that suggest the potential for life. The likelihood of life depends on factors such as surface temperature (which infuences availability of liquid water) the planets and stars temperature, gravitational acceleration, and average density. We propose a metric that allows find the most interesting planets using these parameters. Unlike commonly used methods, our metodic allows to find potentially interesting exoplanets using a user-adjustable combination of parameters.

This project shows the potential of the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory to directly image known exoplanets, in comparison with existing telescopes. It also allows to find the most interesting earthlike planets.
